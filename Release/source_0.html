Being the singing enthusiast that you are, winning this thing this afternoon is the goal you've been building up towards ever since you came fourth last time. The school very rudely declined your request to be excused from all the morning lessons so that you could prepare, and that's why you've just had to put up with a double period of Chemistry, your least favourite subject.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">Thankfully the lesson's drawing to an end now, just after a mind-numbingly dull demonstration by the teacher. He, suddenly looking rather flustered, notices the time and realises that he's late for a meeting. You're unlucky enough to be the first person to catch his eye, and you hear him ask you to do him a favour and tidy up the mess on his desk from his practical demonstration.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">With that, he disappears, and your classmates (most of whom had packed up about five minutes ago in their eagerness for lunch) quickly leave after him. All of them apart from Leila Carlson, that is. She came second in the talent competition last year and is determined to win this time. You hate each other with mutual enthusiasm.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">'Ready to lose this afternoon?' she sneers. Without waiting for a reply, she leaves the room, laughing. God you hate her.</span>&quot;</p>
