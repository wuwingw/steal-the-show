# Steal The Show

_It's the day of your school's annual talent competition. Being the singing enthusiast that you are, winning this thing this afternoon is the goal you've been building up towards ever since you came fourth last time..._

## About

A text adventure/piece of interactive fiction built using Inform 7. Still a work in progress; the game informs you when you've reached the end of what I've implemented so far.

Try it out! https://wuwingw.github.io/steal-the-show/Release/index.html

It can either be played in-browser, or there's a link to download the .zblorb file.
